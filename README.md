### Hi there 👋
 
I'm a full stack web developer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript React.js, React Native, Redux, Node.js, CSS3, SCSS, Material UI, Ant Design, Firebase and Google Cloud. 
I am currently working on a side project called Audezi. It is a SaaS product that allows blog writers convert their blog text into natural-sounding speech using an API powered by Google's AI technologies.
I am a self thought developer, have a can-do-attitude and enjoy converting coffee to code everyday. ☕️ 👩🏽‍💻
